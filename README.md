  ### House Price Prediction
- This project was worked to see what all factors are taken into consideration by a potential home buyer in Bangalore city. The team which worked on this project of size 4, where we all collaborated as team, analyzed the data using various relevant visualization and then we applied regression analysis to answer the big question. We used Python language to ingest the data in a data frame, cleansed the data, then we applied ‚ÄúPlotty‚Äù package to visualize the data and then we used regression model.
- **Technologies:** Plotty, Python, Regression models

### Chatbot
In a collaborative university project involving a team of four, I played a pivotal role in the development of a sophisticated Chatbot using Chatbot. This experience not only showcased my individual contributions to the project but also highlighted my ability to work seamlessly within a team. Our goal was to create an intelligent conversational agent capable of dynamic and context-aware dialogues. Leveraging Chatbot‚Äôs Python library, we successfully implemented a robust and interactive chat interface. Throughout the project, I actively contributed to programming tasks, problem-solving, and the integration of third-party libraries. This collaborative effort not only demonstrated my technical prowess but also underscored my commitment to teamwork and shared success.
